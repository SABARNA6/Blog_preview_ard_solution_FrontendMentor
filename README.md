## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- `@font-face` for custom fonts


### What I learned
During this challenge, I improved my understanding of CSS variables and styling interactive elements using hover states. I also practiced embedding fonts using `@font-face` and designing components with Flexbox.

Here are a few snippets I'm proud of:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  --bg-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --gray-500: hsl(0, 0%, 42%);
  --gray-950: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
  --font-size: 14px;
  --font-family: 'figtree';
}
```
### Continued development
In future projects, I plan to:

-Enhance accessibility (keyboard focus states, ARIA attributes)
-Explore using utility-first CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS
-Convert this into a React component
